## Bible study: **Crucified – Old Self Declared Dead**

**Theme Scripture:**\
**Galatians 2:20** (NKJV)

\

“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Related Scriptures

-   **Galatians 5:24** – “Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.”

-   **Romans 6:4–6** – “Our old self was crucified… that we might walk in newness of life.”

-   **Colossians 3:3–4** – “You have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.”      

-   **2 Corinthians 5:15** – “…so that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who died and was raised.”

## 📖 Bible Study: Galatians 2:20

### Exposition in four points:

-   **Paradox of death & life** – Though “dead” to the old self, we *live* spiritually **through** Christ\
-   **Not I, but Christ** – Our new identity is Christ Himself living in us—He shapes our thoughts and actions.
-   **Living by faith** – Our daily life is sustained not by law or self-effort, but by trusting Jesus.
-   **Christ’s sacrificial love** – His death was personal and intentional: “who loved me and gave himself for me”.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Application Points

1.  **Let go of past labels** — physically discard labels that no longer define you.\
2.  **Welcome Christ’s life** — begin your day saying, “Christ lives in me.”\
3.  **Practice daily faith** — before tasks, pause and choose to trust Christ.\
4.  **Live out gratitude** — look for ways today to express thanks for His sacrifice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🗣️ Discussion Questions

-   What “old labels” or habits feel like they define you?
-   What does your life look like *after* being “crucified” with Christ?
-   How can trusting Christ shape decisions this week?
-   How does knowing He died specifically for **you** change your identity?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## 🔹 Week 2 – Christ Lives in Me

**Key Scripture:**  
**Romans 8:10** (ESV)  
> *"But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness."*  

---

### 🧠 Discussion Questions
- What does it mean that *Christ lives in me* rather than just *I live like Christ*?
- How does His presence shape your decisions, friendships, and emotions?
- Can you share a moment when you sensed Jesus actively guiding or comforting you?

---

### 🎯 Applications
- **Mirror Affirmation:** Write “Christ lives in me” on a mirror; declare it aloud each morning.
- **Soul Check-Ins:** Pause 2–3 times daily to ask: “Am I living from Christ in me or from my own strength?”
- **Prayer Prompt:** *“Jesus, help me sense Your life within me today.”*

---

## 🔹 Week 3 – Living by Faith in the Son of God

**Key Scripture:**  
**Galatians 3:11** (ESV)  
> *"Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith."*  

---

### 🧠 Discussion Questions
- What’s the difference between living by faith vs. trying harder on your own?
- Which areas of your life need stronger trust in Christ?
- Why is faith in *the Son of God* different than any other kind of faith?

---

### 🎯 Applications
- **Faith Journal:** Write down one area needing faith daily ("trust in exams," "friendship conflict") and note where God shows up.
- **Accountability Pair:** Share your faith goal for the week; check in midweek.
- **Prayer Prompt:** *“God, help me to live today by faith in Your Son, not by my own strength.”*

---

## 🔹 Week D – Loved & Given for Me

**Key Scripture:**  
**John 15:13** (ESV)  
> *"Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends."* 

**Galatians 2:20** reminder  
> *“…who loved me and gave himself for me.”*

---

### 🧠 Discussion Questions
- What difference does it make that Jesus *personally* gave Himself for *you*?
- Have you experienced sacrificial love that reminded you of Christ’s?
- How can you show sacrificial love to someone this week?

---

### 🎯 Applications
- **Gratitude Prayer:** Spend quiet time thanking Jesus for His love; share one personal gratitude each.
- **Love in Action:** Commit to one sacrificial act (helping someone, encouraging, volunteering).
- **Reflection Prompt:** *“How does knowing I’m personally loved empower me to love others?”*




## 🙏 Prayer & Reflection

-   **Quiet moment**: Sit with Galatians 2:20, asking God to reveal areas still tied to your old self.
-   **Group prayer**: “Christ, thank You… You’ve replaced my old self with Your life. Help me walk by faith today.”
