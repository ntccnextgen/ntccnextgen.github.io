- New Testament: A Shift in Perspective
  - Peter’s Vision (Acts 10):
  In a pivotal vision, Peter sees a sheet lowered from heaven containing “all kinds of animals,” including unclean ones. A voice says: “What God has made clean, do not call profane.”   - This is generally understood to symbolize:
	  1.	No longer distinguishing between Jews and Gentiles in early Christianity.
	  2.	A shift in food laws—implying that all foods are clean for believers.
- Jesus’ Teaching (Matthew 15:11):

  - “It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth”; emphasizing moral purity over dietary regulations

**Theme Scripture for today**\
**James 2:14–18** 
:::
\

::: {.fragment}

_"14What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? 15If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, 16and one of you says to them, 'Go in peace, be warmed and filled,' without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? 17So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
18But someone will say, 'You have faith and I have works.' Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works."_

:::

## Bible study: **Walking in Good Works (continued)** {.scrollable}

::: {.fragment}

- Dead Faith vs. Living Faith
  - Dead faith is like saying “Happy birthday” without a card, effort, or invitation—meaningless without action. Faith must be alive and expressed through deeds.
  
  - Living faith combines belief with action, authentically reflecting Christ’s love.
  
- *Illustration*: A tree that never bears fruit is just a decoration. But a fruit-bearing tree shows it’s alive and thriving.
-  “Faith that doesn’t work is as useless as a car that cannot drive, a plane that lacks the ability to fly, or a ship that cannot sail.”
:::

## Bible study: **Walking in Good Works (continued)** {.scrollable}

::: {.fragment}
- True Faith Produces Action

  - James emphasizes that authentic faith naturally leads to good works. Deeds don’t earn salvation, but they’re the evidence of genuine faith.
  - This aligns with Ephesians 2:10: we are created in Christ to walk in good works—not to become God’s handiwork—but because we already are.

- *Illustration*: A lamp plugged in but not turned on is useless. Faith must be “switched on” through loving actions.
- "A train’s engine (faith) must pull cars (works) to fulfill its purpose—both are essential.  "

- Skepticism Addressed
  - Some argue, “Faith alone saves, not works.” James isn’t denying that; he’s arguing that true faith—saving faith—never stands alone. If there’s no fruit, something is missing.
  - Practical faith energizes worship, service, compassion, and acts of love.
- *Illustration*: A doctor’s prescription is useless if the patient never takes the medicine. Faith must be “taken” through action to be effective.

[Verse 1]
When the music fades

All is stripped away

And I simply come

Longing just to bring

Something that's of worth

That will bless Your heart

\

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself

Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear

You're looking into my heart

\

[Chorus]
I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

\

[Verse 2]
King of endless worth

No one could express

How much you deserve

Though I'm weak and poor

All I have is Yours

Every single breath!

\

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself

Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear

You're looking into my heart 

\

[Chorus]

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

\

[Outro]

All about you

I'll bring you more than a song

I'll bring you more than a song

More than a song

I'll bring you more than a song

I'll bring you more than a song
(than a song)

You're looking into my heart, looking into my heart

You're looking into my heart

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

## 🎵 Lyric highlights {background-image="images/vincentiu-solomon-ln5drpv_ImI-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

  - "Change my heart o God" is written by Eddie Espinosa in 1982, this worship classic emerged not in a studio, but from a moment of heartfelt prayer.
  -	The inspiration struck while Espinosa was stuck in traffic near Disneyland, praying for God to transform his heart. He began to sing the lyrics spontaneously, as if receiving divine dictation. At the next light, he grabbed scrap paper to jot down the words, preserving the song that would soon resonate worldwide. 
  -	The lyrics “Change my heart, O God… may I be like You” express raw humility and sincere surrender. It’s a proactive, personal prayer to become more like Jesus.
	- Teaching the story behind the song—written in a traffic jam—helps youth see that God inspires worship even in everyday moments.
