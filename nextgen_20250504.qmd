## Bible study: "In His Image: Discovering Our Divine Design"

üìñ Scriptures:

- Genesis 1:26‚Äì28 ‚Äì God creates humanity in His image.
- Psalm 139:13‚Äì16 ‚Äì We are fearfully and wonderfully made.
- Ephesians 2:10 ‚Äì We are God‚Äôs workmanship, created for good works.
	
## Bible study: Introduction: The Quest for Identity

- In a world filled with social media, peer pressure, and societal expectations, many youth grapple with questions like:

  - Who am I?
  - Do I matter?
  - What is my purpose?

- The Bible provides clear answers: You are made in God‚Äôs image, intentionally designed, and purposed for good works.

## Bible study: The Image of God - God‚Äôs Image Bearers

- Genesis 1:26‚Äì28

- ***"Then God said, 'Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness‚Ä¶'" (Genesis 1:26) ***

- Key Insights:
 - Being made in God‚Äôs image means we reflect His character‚Äîlove, creativity, reason, and authority.
 - Unlike animals or any other creation, humans have a unique capacity for relationship with God and others.
 - This identity is foundational; it‚Äôs not based on achievements, appearance, or social status.

## Bible study: Uniquely Crafted

- Psalm 139:13‚Äì16

- ***For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother‚Äôs womb‚Ä¶ (Psalm 139:13)***

- Key Insights:
 - God was intimately involved in our creation; every detail of our being is purposeful.
 - Our personalities, talents, and even quirks are part of His design.
 - Recognizing this combats feelings of inadequacy or comparison.
 
## Bible study: God‚Äôs Masterpiece

- Ephesians 2:10

  - "For we are God‚Äôs handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works‚Ä¶" (Ephesians 2:10)

- Key Insights:
 - "Handiwork" or "masterpiece" implies we are God‚Äôs work of art.
 - Our purpose is not self-defined but God-given‚Äîto do good works prepared for us.
 - Embracing this leads to a fulfilling life aligned with God‚Äôs plan.


## Bible study: Discussion

1.	Personal Reflection: What does being made in God‚Äôs image mean to you?
2.	Perception Shift: How does this understanding influence how you view yourself and others?
3.	Appreciating Diversity: Why is it important to value the differences in others?
4.	Facing Challenges: How can this truth help when dealing with identity struggles or bullying?

## Turn your eyes upon Jesus

:::{.fragment}
Verse 1

O soul, are you weary and troubled?

No light in the darkness you see?

There‚Äôs light for a look at the Savior,

And life more abundant and free. 

:::

## 

Chorus

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,

Look full in His wonderful face,

And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

In the light of His glory and grace. 

##

Verse 2

Through death into life everlasting,

He passed, and we follow Him there;

O‚Äôer us sin no more hath dominion,

For more than conquerors we are. 

##
Chorus

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,

Look full in His wonderful face,

And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

In the light of His glory and grace. 

##  How Great Thou Art

Verse 1

O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder

Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;

I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,

Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

## 

Chorus

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,

How great Thou art, how great Thou art.

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,

How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

## 
Verse 2

When through the woods and forest glades I wander,

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.

When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,

And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

##  Amazing Grace

Verse 1 

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now am found,

Was blind, but now I see. 

## 

Verse 2 

‚ÄôTwas grace that taught my heart to fear,

And grace my fears relieved;

How precious did that grace appear

The hour I first believed! 

## Verse 3 

The Lord hath promised good to me,

His word my hope secures;

He will my shield and portion be,

As long as life endures. 

## Verse 4

When we‚Äôve been there ten thousand years,

Bright shining as the sun,

We‚Äôve no less days to sing God‚Äôs praise

Than when we first begun. 

## Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)

Verse 1

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now am found,

Was blind, but now I see.

## Verse 2

‚ÄôTwas grace that taught my heart to fear,

And grace my fears relieved;

How precious did that grace appear

The hour I first believed!

My chains are gone, I‚Äôve been set free

My God, my Savior has ransomed me

And like a flood His mercy reigns

Unending love, amazing grace

## Verse 3

The Lord has promised good to me

His word my hope secures

He will my shield and portion be

As long as life endures

## Verse 4

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow

The sun forbear to shine

But God, who called me here below

Will be forever mine

## Chorus

My chains are gone, I‚Äôve been set free

My God, my Savior has ransomed me

And like a flood His mercy reigns

Unending love, amazing grace
