## Bible study: Broken but Redeemed

üìñ Scriptures:Romans 5:6‚Äì8 (NKJV)

"For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."


- A. We Are All Broken
  - We don‚Äôt see ourselves fully broken, but we recognize brokenness around us‚Äîin sin, pain, and suffering.
  - Once broken, impossible to restore ourselves‚Äîonly God can mend us.

- B. Unmerited Gift of Redemption
  - Christ died for us, while still sinners‚Äînot after we cleaned up.
  - The focus shifts from works to God‚Äôs sacrificial grace, as Paul emphasizes.

- C. Redemption Turns Brokenness Beautiful
  - Stories of Sarah, Naomi, Moses illustrate how God restores & thrives through brokenness.
  - It‚Äôs not OR redemption‚Äîit‚Äôs redemption through brokenness.


## Discussion

- How do you see brokenness in your own life‚Äîeven when others don‚Äôt?
-	What challenge keeps you from fully believing Christ died for you?
-	How can we welcome redemption through our brokenness, not just after?
-	How does knowing we were undeserving shape our gratitude?


## Bible study: God Still Uses the Broken - Power in Weakness

üìñ Scriptures:2 Corinthians 12:7-10 (NKJV)

"7And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. 8Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. 9And He said to me, ‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ‚Äôs sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong."


"And He said to me, <p style="color: red;">'My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.'</p> Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. "

## Turn your eyes upon Jesus

:::{.fragment}
Verse 1

O soul, are you weary and troubled?

No light in the darkness you see?

There‚Äôs light for a look at the Savior,

And life more abundant and free. 

:::

## 

Chorus

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,

Look full in His wonderful face,

And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

In the light of His glory and grace. 

##

Verse 2

Through death into life everlasting,

He passed, and we follow Him there;

O‚Äôer us sin no more hath dominion,

For more than conquerors we are. 

##
Chorus

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,

Look full in His wonderful face,

And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

In the light of His glory and grace. 

##  How Great Thou Art

Verse 1

O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder

Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;

I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,

Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

## 

Chorus

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,

How great Thou art, how great Thou art.

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,

How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

## 
Verse 2

When through the woods and forest glades I wander,

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.

When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,

And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

##  Amazing Grace

Verse 1 

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now am found,

Was blind, but now I see. 

## 

Verse 2 

‚ÄôTwas grace that taught my heart to fear,

And grace my fears relieved;

How precious did that grace appear

The hour I first believed! 

## Verse 3 

The Lord hath promised good to me,

His word my hope secures;

He will my shield and portion be,

As long as life endures. 

## Verse 4

When we‚Äôve been there ten thousand years,

Bright shining as the sun,

We‚Äôve no less days to sing God‚Äôs praise

Than when we first begun. 

## Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)

Verse 1

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now am found,

Was blind, but now I see.

## Verse 2

‚ÄôTwas grace that taught my heart to fear,

And grace my fears relieved;

How precious did that grace appear

The hour I first believed!

## Chorus

My chains are gone, I‚Äôve been set free

My God, my Savior has ransomed me

And like a flood His mercy reigns

Unending love, amazing grace

## Verse 3

The Lord has promised good to me

His word my hope secures

He will my shield and portion be

As long as life endures

## Verse 4

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow

The sun forbear to shine

But God, who called me here below

Will be forever mine

## Chorus

My chains are gone, I‚Äôve been set free

My God, my Savior has ransomed me

And like a flood His mercy reigns

Unending love, amazing grace
