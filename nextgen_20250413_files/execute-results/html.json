We serve students from incoming 7th grade to high school Seniors going off to college each summer. Campers get to be themselves and develop deep friendships with their peers and counselors, all the while being encouraged to explore faith and God.*\n\n\\\n\\\n\n-   Date: June 11-15, 2025\n-   Location: Lakeview Baptist Assembly, Lone Star, Texas\n-   Registration: [Early Registration (April 18 - May 4) = \\$420.00 per camper](https://www.dccyc.org/register-706291-145819.html)\n\n## Masterpiece\n\n\\\n\\\n\n**Ephesians 2:10 (NLT)**\n\n\\\n\\\n\n\"*\"For we are God’s* masterpiece*. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.\"*\"\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Understanding Our Divine Purpose\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n**Objective:**\n\n\\\n\\\n\nRecognize that God has a unique plan and purpose for each of you, as illustrated in Jeremiah 1:5.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Icebreaker Activity: “Who am I?” (15 minutes)\n\n\\\n**Each will be assigned a person (postit on back).**\n\n-   Within three minutes,\n-   Go and look for person who can answer one question about the person you are carrying after winning a round of rock-paper-scissors.\n-   Sample questions: -\"Girl or boy?'”'\n    -   \"Wearing glasses?\"\n    -   \"Wearing jeans?\"\n\n::: fragment\n### When time is up, describe who *you* are.\n:::\n\n## Icebreaker game: \"Rock, paper, what\"\n\n-   divide into two groups (odd and even)\n-   send one person from each group to the middle\n-   play rock, paper and odd/even, show any number of fingers\n-   if the total number is odd, the odd group wins!\n\n## Bible Study: Exploring Jeremiah 1:5\n\n**Scripture Focus:**\n\nJeremiah 1:5 (NKJV)\n\n*\"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations.\"*\n\n# \n\n**Discussion Points:**\n\n-   What does it mean that God knew us before we were formed?\n-   How does understanding that God has a purpose for us before birth influence our self-perception?\n-   In what ways can we seek and understand God’s calling in our lives?\n-   Do you daydream? About what?\n\n## Session 2: Embracing Our Identity in Christ\n\n**Objective:** To reinforce the understanding of our identity as God’s creation and how it shapes our daily lives.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Short Message: “Who Am I in God’s Eyes?”\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n-   We are intentionally created by God with purpose and love.\n-   Our value is inherent, not based on achievements or others’ opinions.\n-   Understanding our identity in Christ empowers us to live authentically and purposefully.\n\n# \n\n**Movie**\n\n\\\n\\\n\n[Risen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B01BT5MMX2/ref=atv_hm_vid_c_baeECJ_1_3)\n\n# Next week\n\nBible reading plan: [**BibleProject \\| Holy Week & Easter**](https://www.bible.com/reading-plans/36091-bibleproject-holy-week-easter)\n\n![](images/clipboard-971817415.png)\n\n## Groupme\n\n![](images/clipboard-2363909683.png)\n",
