# Game time: 

- Tell two truths and one lie about yourself
- For example: "I love instant noodles.  I play hockey for my school.  I have been to Iceland."
- Don't exaggerate like: "I was US president" or "I am an NBA player"
- Example to consider:
  - "I ran for school government president."
  - "I like sushi but not wasabi."
  - "I like animals except rats.... and roaches."
  - No same genre
  - No recycling

*Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus* is written by the blind Helen H. Lemmel in 1918. She authored both the music and lyrics entirely in 1918, despite being blind at the time. The British musician moved to the US when twelve then studied music in Germany in 1907, where she met her husband and returned to US in 1911. A few years after her marriage, a tragic illness caused her to lose her vision. Her husband, refusing to attend to a blind wife, left her. This time of hurt and loss weighed heavily upon Helen. 

in 1918, Lemmel was introduced to a pamphlet written by Algerian missionary Lilias Trotter. Trotter was a well-known artist who gave up a lucrative career to serve the Lord on the mission field. Her words stirred the heart of Lemmel. She writes, ‚ÄúSuddenly, as if commanded to stop and listen, I stood still, and, singing in my soul and spirit was the chorus, with not one conscious moment of putting word to word to make rhyme, or note to note to make melody‚Ä¶These verses were written‚Ä¶the same week‚Ä¶‚Äù ([Micah Hendry in *Hymn History: Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus*](https://enjoyingthejourney.org/hymn-history-turn-your-eyes-upon-jesus/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

- The hymn echoes Hebrews 12:2, urging believers to ‚Äúrun‚Ä¶ fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith‚Äù
- "Turn full your soul‚Äôs vision to Jesus‚Ä¶ and a strange dimness will come over all that is apart from Him"
	
## Bible study: Broken but Redeemed

üìñ Scriptures:Romans 5:6‚Äì8 (NKJV)

"For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."


## Bible study: 

- A. We Are All Broken
  - We don‚Äôt see ourselves fully broken, but we recognize brokenness around us‚Äîin sin, pain, and suffering.
  - Once broken, impossible to restore ourselves‚Äîonly God can mend us.

- B. Unmerited Gift of Redemption
  - Christ died for us, while still sinners‚Äînot after we cleaned up.
  - The focus shifts from works to God‚Äôs sacrificial grace, as Paul emphasizes.

- C. Redemption Turns Brokenness Beautiful
  - Stories of Sarah, Naomi, Moses illustrate how God restores & thrives through brokenness.
  - It‚Äôs not OR redemption‚Äîit‚Äôs redemption through brokenness.


## Discussion

- How do you see brokenness in your own life‚Äîeven when others don‚Äôt?
-	What challenge keeps you from fully believing Christ died for you?
-	How can we welcome redemption through our brokenness, not just after?
-	How does knowing we were undeserving shape our gratitude?

## Turn your eyes upon Jesus

:::{.fragment}
Verse 1

O soul, are you weary and troubled?

No light in the darkness you see?

There‚Äôs light for a look at the Savior,

And life more abundant and free. 

:::

## 

Chorus

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,

Look full in His wonderful face,

And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

In the light of His glory and grace. 

##

Verse 2

Through death into life everlasting,

He passed, and we follow Him there;

O‚Äôer us sin no more hath dominion,

For more than conquerors we are. 

##
Chorus

Turn your eyes upon Jesus,

Look full in His wonderful face,

And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,

In the light of His glory and grace. 

##  How Great Thou Art

Verse 1

O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder

Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;

I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,

Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

## 

Chorus

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,

How great Thou art, how great Thou art.

Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,

How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

## 
Verse 2

When through the woods and forest glades I wander,

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.

When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,

And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

##  Amazing Grace

Verse 1 

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now am found,

Was blind, but now I see. 

## 

Verse 2 

‚ÄôTwas grace that taught my heart to fear,

And grace my fears relieved;

How precious did that grace appear

The hour I first believed! 

## Verse 3 

The Lord hath promised good to me,

His word my hope secures;

He will my shield and portion be,

As long as life endures. 

## Verse 4

When we‚Äôve been there ten thousand years,

Bright shining as the sun,

We‚Äôve no less days to sing God‚Äôs praise

Than when we first begun. 

## Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)

Verse 1

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now am found,

Was blind, but now I see.

## Verse 2

‚ÄôTwas grace that taught my heart to fear,

And grace my fears relieved;

How precious did that grace appear

The hour I first believed!

## Chorus

My chains are gone, I‚Äôve been set free

My God, my Savior has ransomed me

And like a flood His mercy reigns

Unending love, amazing grace

## Verse 3

The Lord has promised good to me

His word my hope secures

He will my shield and portion be

As long as life endures

## Verse 4

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow

The sun forbear to shine

But God, who called me here below

Will be forever mine

## Chorus

My chains are gone, I‚Äôve been set free

My God, my Savior has ransomed me

And like a flood His mercy reigns

Unending love, amazing grace
