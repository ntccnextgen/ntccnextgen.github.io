1.  Jesus’ New Commandment

-   Not optional: Love isn’t a suggestion, it’s a command.
-   New in quality: Not just “love your neighbor” (Leviticus 19:18), but “love as I have loved you.”
    -   Jesus sets Himself as the standard of love.
-   *Illustration*: Imagine a sports team where the coach doesn’t just shout plays but steps on the field to play alongside them. Jesus didn’t just tell us to love—He demonstrated it by washing feet (John 13:1–17) and laying down His life.

2.  Authentic vs. Shallow Relationships

-   Shallow love: based on convenience, emotions, or appearances.

-   Authentic love: marked by sacrifice, consistency, and truth.

-   Authentic relationships are safe places for honesty, forgiveness, and encouragement.

-   *Illustration*: Think of a phone battery. A shallow relationship is like a battery that drains quickly—it won’t last under stress. Authentic relationships are like a fully charged battery, sustaining energy through trials.

3.  Love as Action, Not Just Feeling

-   Jesus loved by serving, healing, teaching, and sacrificing.

-   Real love isn’t just words but deeds.

-   1 John 3:18: “Let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.”

-   *Illustration* (Real-Life Story): Corrie Ten Boom and her family hid Jews during WWII, risking their lives because of their love for Christ. After surviving a concentration camp, Corrie forgave even her guards. Her story shows that Christian love is not just emotion—it’s costly action and supernatural forgiveness.

-   “Do you know what hurts so very much? It's love. Love is the strongest force in the world, and when it is blocked that means pain. There are two things we can do when this happens. We can kill that love so that it stops hurting. But then of course part of us dies, too. Or we can ask God to open up another route for that love to travel.”
-   “There is no pit so deep, that God's love is not deeper still.”

4.  Love as a Witness to the World

-   Jesus says this love is how “everyone will know” we are His disciples.

-   The world doesn’t recognize us by buildings or programs, but by how we treat each other.

-   *Illustration*: In the early church, Roman leaders noticed how Christians cared for the sick and poor—even those who weren’t believers. Their radical love was a testimony that Jesus was real.

**Corrie Ten Boom**

Corrie Ten Boom was a Dutch Christian during World War II. Her family owned a watch shop in the Netherlands, but more importantly, their home became a safe house for Jews fleeing the Nazis. They built a secret room behind a wall where people could hide when German soldiers came searching.

One day, the family was betrayed, and Corrie, her sister Betsie, and her father were arrested. Her father died soon after, and Corrie and Betsie were sent to the Ravensbrück concentration camp. Life there was brutal—hunger, sickness, and cruelty surrounded them. Yet Betsie reminded Corrie, “There is no pit so deep that God’s love is not deeper still.”

Betsie eventually died in the camp, but Corrie survived. After the war, she began speaking about God’s love and forgiveness. At one church service, a former prison guard from Ravensbrück came up to her. He told her he had become a Christian and asked Corrie to forgive him.

Corrie said in that moment, she couldn’t do it on her own—but she prayed, “Jesus, help me.” God gave her the strength, and she shook the man’s hand, telling him she forgave him.

\[Verse 1\] When the music fades

All is stripped away

And I simply come

Longing just to bring

Something that's of worth

That will bless Your heart

\

\[Pre-Chorus\] I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself

Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear

You're looking into my heart

\

\[Chorus\] I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

\

\[Verse 2\] King of endless worth

No one could express

How much you deserve

Though I'm weak and poor

All I have is Yours

Every single breath!

For a song in itself

Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear

You're looking into my heart

\

\[Chorus\]

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

All about you

I'll bring you more than a song

I'll bring you more than a song

More than a song

I'll bring you more than a song

I'll bring you more than a song (than a song)

You're looking into my heart, looking into my heart

You're looking into my heart

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

## 🎵 Lyric highlights {background-image="images/vincentiu-solomon-ln5drpv_ImI-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

-   "Change my heart o God" is written by Eddie Espinosa in 1982, this worship classic emerged not in a studio, but from a moment of heartfelt prayer.
-   The inspiration struck while Espinosa was stuck in traffic near Disneyland, praying for God to transform his heart. He began to sing the lyrics spontaneously, as if receiving divine dictation. At the next light, he grabbed scrap paper to jot down the words, preserving the song that would soon resonate worldwide.
-   The lyrics “Change my heart, O God… may I be like You” express raw humility and sincere surrender. It’s a proactive, personal prayer to become more like Jesus.
    -   Teaching the story behind the song—written in a traffic jam—helps youth see that God inspires worship even in everyday moments.
