We lift up every family devastated by loss and those still awaiting news of missing loved ones. Surround them with Your comfort, peace, and strength.

Hold the hearts of grieving children and parents; let them feel Your nearness in the silence of their tears. Provide hope when the night seems endless.

Protect and empower the brave responders and volunteers. Grant them endurance, courage, and wisdom in each life-saving action.

Be with neighboring communities as they begin recovery, repair, and rebuilding. May they find resilience and support in You.

Bring hope in the midst of tragedy, reminding the brokenhearted that You are ever near. May Your presence bring restoration and new beginnings.

## Bible study: **Crucified – Old Self Declared Dead**

**Theme Scripture:**\
**Galatians 2:20** (NKJV)

\

“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Related Scriptures

-   **Galatians 5:24** – “Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.”

-   **Romans 6:4–6** – “Our old self was crucified… that we might walk in newness of life.”

-   **Colossians 3:3–4** – “You have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.”      

-   **2 Corinthians 5:15** – “…so that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who died and was raised.”

## 📖 Bible Study: Galatians 2:20

### Exposition in four points:

-   **Paradox of death & life** – Though “dead” to the old self, we *live* spiritually **through** Christ\
-   **Not I, but Christ** – Our new identity is Christ Himself living in us—He shapes our thoughts and actions.
-   **Living by faith** – Our daily life is sustained not by law or self-effort, but by trusting Jesus.
-   **Christ’s sacrificial love** – His death was personal and intentional: “who loved me and gave himself for me”.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🌱 Real-Life Examples

-   **Baptism** → symbolic burial of the old self, new life in Christ (Romans 6) [oai_citation:8‡gotquestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/crucified-with-Christ.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
-   A friend overcame addiction **not** by willpower, but by daily reliance on Christ’s strength—betraying old identity.
-   **John Piper**: “Our old self — our unbelieving, rebellious, loving-sin self — dies with him. Our new self is created by the Spirit…” [oai_citation:9‡desiringgod.org](https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/how-does-christ-live-in-me-galatians-2-20?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💡 Application Points

1.  **Let go of past labels** — physically discard labels that no longer define you.\
2.  **Welcome Christ’s life** — begin your day saying, “Christ lives in me.”\
3.  **Practice daily faith** — before tasks, pause and choose to trust Christ.\
4.  **Live out gratitude** — look for ways today to express thanks for His sacrifice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🗣️ Discussion Questions

-   What “old labels” or habits feel like they define you?
-   What does your life look like *after* being “crucified” with Christ?
-   How can trusting Christ shape decisions this week?
-   How does knowing He died specifically for **you** change your identity?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🙏 Prayer & Reflection

-   **Quiet moment**: Sit with Galatians 2:20, asking God to reveal areas still tied to your old self.
-   **Group prayer**: “Christ, thank You… You’ve replaced my old self with Your life. Help me walk by faith today.”
