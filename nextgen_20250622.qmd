’Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His word;
Just to rest upon His promise;

Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus!
  O for grace to trust Him more.

## Game time: Superhero, Superpower

- What is your favorite superhero?
- What superpower do you want to have? (could be different from previous question)
- What is the weakest thing your superhero have? (e.g. Ironman suite can be out of power)


## Bible study: Broken but Redeemed

📖 Scriptures:Romans 5:6–8 (NKJV)

"For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

<h5> 

- A. We Are All Broken
  - We don’t see ourselves fully broken, but we recognize brokenness around us—in sin, pain, and suffering.
  - Once broken, impossible to restore ourselves—only God can mend us.

- B. Unmerited Gift of Redemption
  - Christ died for us, while still sinners—not after we cleaned up.
  - The focus shifts from works to God’s sacrificial grace, as Paul emphasizes.

- C. Redemption Turns Brokenness Beautiful
  - Stories of Sarah, Naomi, Moses illustrate how God restores & thrives through brokenness.
  - It’s not OR redemption—it’s redemption through brokenness.
</h5>

## Discussion

- How do you see brokenness in your own life—even when others don’t?
-	What challenge keeps you from fully believing Christ died for you?
-	How can we welcome redemption through our brokenness, not just after?
-	How does knowing we were undeserving shape our gratitude?


## Bible study: God Still Uses the Broken - Power in Weakness

📖 Scriptures:2 Corinthians 12:7-10 (NKJV)

"7And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. 8Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. 9And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong."


"And He said to me, <p style="color: red;">'My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.'</p> Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. "

## Bible study: God Still Uses the Broken - Power in Weakness (continued)

- Key Point: Paul saw his thorn (brokenness) not as a barrier, but a way to experience God’s power.

- Discussion Questions:

	1.	What do you think Paul’s “thorn” could’ve been?
	2.  Do you have your own "thorn"?
	3.	How does God’s strength show up in our weakest moments?
	4.	Have you ever seen someone grow spiritually because of their struggles?

## Bible study: God Still Uses the Broken - Power in Weakness (continued)

- Stories of biblical characters God used after failure:

    -	Peter
        - (denial → preacher)
    -	Jonah
        - (ran away → prophet),
    - Rahab
      - (prostitute → honored in Jesus’ line)
