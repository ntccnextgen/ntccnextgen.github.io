\

::: {.fragment}

_"4There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. 6And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. 7But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: 8for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, 9to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, 10to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 11But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills. 12For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ."_

1. God Made You Unique

- You are God‚Äôs masterpiece (Ephesians 2:10). 
- Each gift reflects His creativity. 
- **Illustration:** 
  - Snowflakes ‚Äî no two are the same, yet together they create beauty.

- Different Gifts, Same Purpose
  - Spiritual gifts are not given for personal glory, but to serve others and build the church.
	- Example gifts listed: wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discernment, tongues, interpretation.
	- Takeaway: God equips each of us uniquely so that together the Body of Christ is complete.

2. Gifts Are for Service, Not Spotlight

- Gifts are meant to serve others, not ourselves. 
- **Real Life Story:** Nick Vujicic, born without arms or legs, has impacted millions with the gift of encouragement.

## üéµ Lyric highlights {background-image="images/vincentiu-solomon-ln5drpv_ImI-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

  - "Change my heart o God" is written by Eddie Espinosa in 1982, this worship classic emerged not in a studio, but from a moment of heartfelt prayer.
  -	The inspiration struck while Espinosa was stuck in traffic near Disneyland, praying for God to transform his heart. He began to sing the lyrics spontaneously, as if receiving divine dictation. At the next light, he grabbed scrap paper to jot down the words, preserving the song that would soon resonate worldwide. 
  -	The lyrics ‚ÄúChange my heart, O God‚Ä¶ may I be like You‚Äù express raw humility and sincere surrender. It‚Äôs a proactive, personal prayer to become more like Jesus.
	- Teaching the story behind the song‚Äîwritten in a traffic jam‚Äîhelps youth see that God inspires worship even in everyday moments.

## Bible study: **Crucified ‚Äì Old Self Declared Dead**

**Theme Scripture:**\
**Galatians 2:20** (NKJV)

\

‚ÄúI have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.‚Äù

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîç Related Scriptures

-   **Galatians 5:24** ‚Äì ‚ÄúThose who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.‚Äù

-   **Romans 6:4‚Äì6** ‚Äì ‚ÄúOur old self was crucified‚Ä¶ that we might walk in newness of life.‚Äù

-   **Colossians 3:3‚Äì4** ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.‚Äù      

-   **2 Corinthians 5:15** ‚Äì ‚Äú‚Ä¶so that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who died and was raised.‚Äù

## üìñ Bible Study: Galatians 2:20

### Exposition in four points:

-   **Paradox of death & life** ‚Äì Though ‚Äúdead‚Äù to the old self, we *live* spiritually **through** Christ\
-   **Not I, but Christ** ‚Äì Our new identity is Christ Himself living in us‚ÄîHe shapes our thoughts and actions.
-   **Living by faith** ‚Äì Our daily life is sustained not by law or self-effort, but by trusting Jesus.
-   **Christ‚Äôs sacrificial love** ‚Äì His death was personal and intentional: ‚Äúwho loved me and gave himself for me‚Äù.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üí° Application Points

1.  **Let go of past labels** ‚Äî physically discard labels that no longer define you.\
2.  **Welcome Christ‚Äôs life** ‚Äî begin your day saying, ‚ÄúChrist lives in me.‚Äù\
3.  **Practice daily faith** ‚Äî before tasks, pause and choose to trust Christ.\
4.  **Live out gratitude** ‚Äî look for ways today to express thanks for His sacrifice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üó£Ô∏è Discussion Questions

-   What does your life look like *after* being ‚Äúcrucified‚Äù with Christ?

**Romans 8:10** (ESV)  
> *"But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness."*

**Key Scripture:**

---

### üß† Discussion Questions
- What‚Äôs the difference between living by faith vs. trying harder on your own?
- Which areas of your life need stronger trust in Christ?

---

## üîπ Week D ‚Äì Loved & Given for Me

**Key Scripture:**

> *"Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends."* 

**Galatians‚ÄØ2:20** reminder  
> *‚Äú‚Ä¶who loved me and gave himself for me.‚Äù*

---

### üß† Discussion Questions
- What difference does it make that Jesus *personally* gave Himself for *you*?
- Have you experienced sacrificial love that reminded you of Christ‚Äôs?

---

### üéØ Applications

- **Love in Action:** Commit to one sacrificial act (helping someone, encouraging, volunteering).
- **Reflection Prompt:** *‚ÄúHow does knowing I‚Äôm personally loved empower me to love others?‚Äù*




## üôè Prayer & Reflection

-   **Group prayer**: ‚ÄúChrist, thank You‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve replaced my old self with Your life. Help me walk by faith today.‚Äù
