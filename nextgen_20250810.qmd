God's Masterpiece - Reflecting His Image and Living Like Jesus

</p>

</h4>

## Theme of the month: "Equipped for Good Works"

### Key Verse: Ephesians 2:10

-   **What is "Masterpiece"?**: 
  - Not an accident, but His artwork, created with purpose and equipped to serve others.
-   **Key analogy**: 
  - a key is designed and crafted to unlock a specific door 
  - each person is uniquely designed to serve in God‚Äôs plan.
-   **Purpose**: To understand our identity as God's masterpiece and how we are equipped to do good works.

## Icebreaker:

- What is your favorite nature scene? Or what nature scene is most beautiful to you?
- Why is that scene beautiful to you?
- Give a bit more detail on the most beautiful nature scene in your memory (e.g. traveling with friends, at a time you were feeling down, etc.).

# <span style="color:white; font-size:80%;">Icebreaker illustration: What makes sunset beautiful?</span>  {background-image="images/sunsets/v2osk-JE01L3hB0GQ-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

- Sunsets are beautiful due to a combination of atmospheric science, cloud formations, and environmental conditions. 
- The primary scientific reason is Rayleigh scattering, where sunlight travels through a thicker layer of the atmosphere at sunset, causing shorter blue and green wavelengths to scatter away, leaving the longer red, orange, and yellow wavelengths to dominate the sky.
- This scattering effect is enhanced by the presence of particles like dust, pollution, and water vapor, which can intensify the colors.

# <span style="color:white; font-size:80%;">Icebreaker illustration: What makes sunset beautiful?</span>  {background-image="images/sunsets/spencer-watson-p0Yupww_SNM-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}


- The presence of clouds, particularly mid-level and high clouds like cirrus or cumulus, acts like a natural screen, reflecting and amplifying these vibrant colors.
- The quality of the sunset is also influenced by the amount of particulate matter in the air; moderate levels of pollution, dust, or wildfire smoke can enhance the scattering effect, intensifying red and orange hues, though excessive pollution can create a hazy, muted display.
- Additionally, factors like humidity, air clarity, and the angle of the sun's descent‚Äîoften longer near the winter solstice‚Äîcan significantly affect the intensity and duration of the colors.

# <span style="color:white; font-size:80%;">Icebreaker illustration: What makes sunset beautiful?</span>  {background-image="images/sunsets/neom--RlktmDy3Ec-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

- The science behind the colors involves Rayleigh scattering, where atmospheric particles scatter shorter blue wavelengths more than longer red and orange wavelengths, which pass through more easily at sunset.
- Clouds are essential for a dramatic sunset, as they reflect the sun's light and create a canvas for the colors; ideal conditions feature mid-level and high clouds with a total cloud cover of 40-60%.
- Particulate matter, including pollution, dust, and smoke from wildfires, can enhance sunset colors by increasing scattering, but only up to a point; too much pollution leads to haze and dullness.
- Geographic and seasonal factors play a role, with sunsets often being more vivid in winter due to longer sunset durations and more defined cloud systems, and over water or at higher altitudes where the sun appears lower on the horizon.
- The perception of beauty is also subjective and can be influenced by personal experience, location, and the emotional context of viewing the sunset, such as being on holiday.

# <span style="color:white; font-size:80%;">Discussion: can you find the same beauty in the sunset every day? Why?</span>  {background-image="images/sunsets/johannes-plenio-qkfxBc2NQ18-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}


- Please think about this for 30 seconds.

# <span style="color:white; font-size:80%;">Takeaway</span>  {background-image="images/sunsets/jason-mavrommatis-GPPAjJicemU-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

- Sunsets are great masterpieces created by God.
- Yet, it is not the greatest handiwork of God.
- What is?



## Bible study: **Equipped for Good Works**

**Theme Scripture:**\
** Ephesians 2:10** (NLT)

\

"For we are God‚Äôs masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago."

::: fragment

- We are God‚Äôs workmanship (poiƒìma) 
	- The Greek word here (œÄŒøŒπŒ∑ŒºŒ±) means ‚Äúthat which is made‚Äù or ‚Äúworkmanship‚Äù 
	- akin to a masterpiece or poem published into existence by a creator. We are not self-made; we are crafted by God, the Master Artist. 
- Created in Christ for good works, prepared beforehand 
	- God not only crafted us but also designed specific ‚Äúgood works‚Äù for us to walk in‚Äîopportunities He has already planned for our lives. These are not random, but intended and prepared.  
:::

## Bible study: **Equipped for Good Works** (continued)

- Key Implications to Share:
  - Salvation and our new identity are gifts of grace‚Äînot a result of our efforts. We are God‚Äôs ***masterpiece*** or workmanship, created in Christ.  
  - Our lives have purposeful design. God has prepared specific good works only we can do, with the gifts, passions, and contexts He‚Äôs given us.  


# Response

::: fragment
-   Write one unique gift of yourself ("quiet listener," "sketcher," etc.).

- Please think about this for 30 seconds.

-   Another: a personal aspiration or value ("kindness," etc.).
-   Third: a moment they felt truly known/seen.

## üéµ Lyric highlights {background-image="images/vincentiu-solomon-ln5drpv_ImI-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

  - "Change my heart o God" is written by Eddie Espinosa in 1982, this worship classic emerged not in a studio, but from a moment of heartfelt prayer.
  -	The inspiration struck while Espinosa was stuck in traffic near Disneyland, praying for God to transform his heart. He began to sing the lyrics spontaneously, as if receiving divine dictation. At the next light, he grabbed scrap paper to jot down the words, preserving the song that would soon resonate worldwide. 
  -	The lyrics ‚ÄúChange my heart, O God‚Ä¶ may I be like You‚Äù express raw humility and sincere surrender. It‚Äôs a proactive, personal prayer to become more like Jesus.
	- Teaching the story behind the song‚Äîwritten in a traffic jam‚Äîhelps youth see that God inspires worship even in everyday moments.

**Galatians 2:20** (NKJV)

\

‚ÄúI have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.‚Äù
