##  **Vocalist & Musician Preparation**

### **Musician Development**
- **Monthly Skill Workshop Nights**: Teach new songs, instrument skills, transitions  
- **PADS Training**: Teach how to trigger backing pads from phone/laptop and layer dynamically  
- Team up newer musicians with more confident ones for mentorship  
- Create a "songbook library" of 20–30 go-to songs and rotate in new ones quarterly

### ️ **Vocalist Preparation**
- Emphasize **blending**, not belting — train in harmony and dynamics  
- Weekly vocal warm-up shared via video or audio clip  
- Teach mic technique, posture, and expressions that avoid performance-focused worship  
- Rotate lead singers every 2–3 weeks to keep different voices involved

## **Song Selection Guidelines**

**Set List Goals:**
- Open with one **high energy** and one **medium praise** song  
- Finish with one **reflective worship** and one **response/altar** song  

**Suggested Rotation Mix (Examples)**  
- **Classic Songs:**  
  - *How Great Is Our God*  
  - *Here I Am to Worship*  
  - *Hosanna (Hillsong)*  
  - *Blessed Be Your Name*  
- **Contemporary Songs:**  
  - *Holy Foever*  
  - *Good good father*  
  - *Praise* (Brandon Lake)
  - *Gratitude* (Brandon Lake)

Refresh the list every semester and check if youth are engaging with lyrics and themes. Encourage requests and testimonies to help shape themes.

## ️ **Gear & Environment Suggestions**

- **PA System:** 2 Speakers + 1–2 floor monitors  
- **Mics:** 2 vocal mics minimum (for duet & harmonies)  
- **Song & Chord Software:** WorshipTools, Planning Center, or OnSong  
- **Slide Operator** (youth volunteer): rehearse with them during final run-through  

##  Next Steps

1. **Recruit Team** (audition/hangout)
2. **Host a Worship Vision & Info Night**
3. **Create Worship Rotation Schedule** (spread responsibilities monthly)
4. **Plan a Seasonal Team Retreat** (once a year)
5. **Launch First Service** (try a “Worship Night Kickoff” in September)
