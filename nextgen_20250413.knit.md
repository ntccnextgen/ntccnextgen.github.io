Recognize that God has a unique plan and purpose for each of you, as illustrated in Jeremiah 1:5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Icebreaker Activity: “Who am I?” (15 minutes)

\
**Each will be assigned a person (postit on back).**

-   Within three minutes,
-   Go and look for person who can answer one question about the person you are carrying after winning a round of rock-paper-scissors.
-   Sample questions: -"Girl or boy?'”'
    -   "Wearing glasses?"
    -   "Wearing jeans?"

::: fragment
### When time is up, describe who *you* are.
:::

## Icebreaker game: "Rock, paper, what"

-   divide into two groups (odd and even)
-   send one person from each group to the middle
-   play rock, paper and odd/even, show any number of fingers
-   if the total number is odd, the odd group wins!

## Bible Study: Exploring Jeremiah 1:5

**Scripture Focus:**

Jeremiah 1:5 (NKJV)

*"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations."*

# 

**Discussion Points:**

-   What does it mean that God knew us before we were formed?
-   How does understanding that God has a purpose for us before birth influence our self-perception?
-   In what ways can we seek and understand God’s calling in our lives?
-   Do you daydream? About what?

## Session 2: Embracing Our Identity in Christ

**Objective:** To reinforce the understanding of our identity as God’s creation and how it shapes our daily lives.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Short Message: “Who Am I in God’s Eyes?”

**Key Points:**

-   We are intentionally created by God with purpose and love.
-   Our value is inherent, not based on achievements or others’ opinions.
-   Understanding our identity in Christ empowers us to live authentically and purposefully.
