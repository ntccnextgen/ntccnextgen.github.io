1. Encouragement is more than compliments.
 - Compliments usually focus on surface things: "Nice shoes," "Good game," "You look great today."
 - But biblical encouragement goes deeper. It points people back to God’s truth, promises, and hope.
 - It’s not just about making someone "feel good," but helping them stand firm in their faith.
 - Example: Paul didn’t just say "You’re awesome, church!" He reminded believers of God’s faithfulness, their identity in Christ, and their eternal hope.

- Illustration: Compliments are like a sugar rush—they give a quick boost but fade fast. Encouragement from God’s Word is like a balanced meal—it gives lasting strength.

2. Encouragement strengthens the weak.

 - Proverbs 12:25: "Anxiety weighs down the heart, but a kind word cheers it up."
 - Proverbs 25:11  "Timely advice is lovely, like golden apples in a silver basket."
 - Life is full of pressures: school stress, family struggles, peer pressure. Encouragement helps lift those heavy loads.
 - Even small words can bring life-changing impact.

- Illustration: Imagine carrying a heavy backpack full of rocks labeled "fear," "stress," "failure." Encouragement is like a friend taking out those rocks one by one.

3. Encouragement builds up the whole body.

 - Paul uses the image of a body (1 Corinthians 12). Each part needs the others to function well.
 - Encouragement is like mortar between bricks—it holds the wall together.
 - When one person is lifted up, the entire community grows stronger.

- Illustration: Olympic runner Derek Redmond tore his hamstring in the 1992 Barcelona games. As he limped toward the finish line, his father ran onto the track, put his arm around him, and helped him cross. The crowd cheered—not because Derek won, but because his father’s encouragement carried him to the end.

\[Verse 1\] When the music fades

All is stripped away

And I simply come

Longing just to bring

Something that's of worth

That will bless Your heart

\

\[Pre-Chorus\] I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself

Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear

You're looking into my heart

\

\[Chorus\] I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

\

\[Verse 2\] King of endless worth

No one could express

How much you deserve

Though I'm weak and poor

All I have is Yours

Every single breath!

\

\[Pre-Chorus\] I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself

Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear

You're looking into my heart

\

\[Chorus\]

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

\

\[Outro\]

All about you

I'll bring you more than a song

I'll bring you more than a song

More than a song

I'll bring you more than a song

I'll bring you more than a song (than a song)

You're looking into my heart, looking into my heart

You're looking into my heart

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

## 🎵 Lyric highlights {background-image="images/vincentiu-solomon-ln5drpv_ImI-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

-   "Change my heart o God" is written by Eddie Espinosa in 1982, this worship classic emerged not in a studio, but from a moment of heartfelt prayer.
-   The inspiration struck while Espinosa was stuck in traffic near Disneyland, praying for God to transform his heart. He began to sing the lyrics spontaneously, as if receiving divine dictation. At the next light, he grabbed scrap paper to jot down the words, preserving the song that would soon resonate worldwide.
-   The lyrics "Change my heart, O God… may I be like You" express raw humility and sincere surrender. It’s a proactive, personal prayer to become more like Jesus.
    -   Teaching the story behind the song—written in a traffic jam—helps youth see that God inspires worship even in everyday moments.
