**Theme Scripture for today: Forgive One Another**\
**Colossians 3:12‚Äì14**

\

::: fragment
*"12Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. 13Make allowance for each other‚Äôs faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others. 14Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony. " (NLT)*

1.  Forgiveness is a command, not a choice.

-   Paul says ‚Äúforgive as the Lord forgave you.‚Äù Our forgiveness flows out of God‚Äôs grace toward us.

-   Without forgiveness, relationships remain broken.

-   Forgiveness is an act of obedience, not a feeling.

-   *Illustration*: Think of a traffic light. When the light turns red, you don‚Äôt debate whether to stop ‚Äî it‚Äôs not optional, it‚Äôs required. In the same way, Paul says ‚Äúforgive as the Lord forgave you.‚Äù Forgiveness isn‚Äôt based on our feelings but on God‚Äôs command.

2.  Forgiveness is costly but healing.

-   It doesn‚Äôt mean forgetting or ignoring hurt, but releasing the right to revenge.

-   Forgiveness brings freedom to both the forgiver and the forgiven.

-   *Illustration*: Picture someone carrying a heavy backpack filled with rocks labeled ‚Äúanger,‚Äù ‚Äúhurt,‚Äù ‚Äúbitterness.‚Äù Forgiveness means setting the backpack down. It doesn‚Äôt erase the fact you were hurt, but it frees you from carrying the weight. The cost is letting go of revenge, but the healing is freedom and peace.

3.  Forgiveness builds unity.

-   Paul says forgiveness, tied with love, creates ‚Äúperfect unity.‚Äù

-   Authentic relationships cannot survive without it.

-   *Illustration* On October 2, 2006, a gunman entered the West Nickel Mines Amish school in Pennsylvania, took ten girls hostage, and shot them, killing five and severely wounding five others before taking his own life.
 The attacker, Charles Carl Roberts IV, was a 32-year-old non-Amish man who expressed anger at God and had brought weapons, restraints, and other items indicating he planned a prolonged assault.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, the Amish community responded with a profound and widely publicized act of forgiveness toward Roberts and his family.

\[Verse 1\] When the music fades

All is stripped away

And I simply come

Longing just to bring

Something that's of worth

That will bless Your heart

\

\[Pre-Chorus\] I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself

Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear

You're looking into my heart

\

\[Chorus\] I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

\

\[Verse 2\] King of endless worth

No one could express

How much you deserve

Though I'm weak and poor

All I have is Yours

Every single breath!

\

\[Pre-Chorus\] I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself

Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear

You're looking into my heart

\

\[Chorus\]

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

\

\[Outro\]

All about you

I'll bring you more than a song

I'll bring you more than a song

More than a song

I'll bring you more than a song

I'll bring you more than a song (than a song)

You're looking into my heart, looking into my heart

You're looking into my heart

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

## üéµ Lyric highlights {background-image="images/vincentiu-solomon-ln5drpv_ImI-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

-   "Change my heart o God" is written by Eddie Espinosa in 1982, this worship classic emerged not in a studio, but from a moment of heartfelt prayer.
-   The inspiration struck while Espinosa was stuck in traffic near Disneyland, praying for God to transform his heart. He began to sing the lyrics spontaneously, as if receiving divine dictation. At the next light, he grabbed scrap paper to jot down the words, preserving the song that would soon resonate worldwide.
-   The lyrics ‚ÄúChange my heart, O God‚Ä¶ may I be like You‚Äù express raw humility and sincere surrender. It‚Äôs a proactive, personal prayer to become more like Jesus.
    -   Teaching the story behind the song‚Äîwritten in a traffic jam‚Äîhelps youth see that God inspires worship even in everyday moments.
