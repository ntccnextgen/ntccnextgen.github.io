_"13For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. 14For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: ‚ÄúYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.‚Äù"_

## Bible study: **Equipped for Good Works: Serving Others with Love (continued)** {.scrollable}

::: {.frgment}

  - Freedom in Christ

    - Paul reminds the Galatians that salvation in Christ means they are no longer slaves to the law or sin.
	  - But freedom is not a license for selfishness. True freedom is the ability to live as God intended‚Äîserving others in love.

- *Illustration*: Think of a driver‚Äôs license. Freedom to drive doesn‚Äôt mean recklessly speeding‚Äîit means using the privilege responsibly to reach good destinations and keep others safe.

::: {.fragment}

  - Serve One Another
    - The Greek word for ‚Äúserve‚Äù (Œ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒµœçœâ (douleu≈ç)) literally means ‚Äúto become a slave.‚Äù Paul flips the concept: we are freed from sin‚Äôs slavery but now willingly serve others in humility.
  	- Christian service is not about recognition, but about meeting needs with Christlike love.

- *Illustration: *
  - Jesus washing the disciples‚Äô feet (John 13:1‚Äì17). 
  - He showed that leadership in God‚Äôs kingdom comes through humble service.

  - Love as the Motive
	  -	Paul connects service with the commandment: ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself‚Äù (Leviticus 19:18).
	  -	Service without love can look like charity, but it doesn‚Äôt reflect Christ‚Äôs heart. Love transforms service into worship.

- *Illustration*: A meal cooked without seasoning can fill the stomach but not delight the taste. Service without love may meet a need, but it doesn‚Äôt nourish the soul.

## Bible study: **Equipped for Good Works: Serving Others with Love Discussion** {.scrollable}

::: {.fragment}

- Love & Service
	1.	Why is love essential when we serve?
	2.	Can service without love still honor God? Why or why not?
	3.	What‚Äôs the difference between serving out of obligation versus serving out of love?

- Motivation
	4.	How does freedom in Christ empower us to serve others?
	5.	What do you think Paul means when he says the ‚Äúentire law‚Äù is fulfilled by loving your neighbor?

- Application
	6.	Who in your life can you serve this week in a small, practical way?
	7.	What gets in the way of serving others with love (e.g., busyness, pride, fear)? How can we overcome those barriers?
	8.	How can serving with love impact friendships, families, or even people outside the church?

# Sharing: What is Love in Bible? {.scrollable}

::: {.fragment}

- 1 Eros (·ºîœÅœâœÇ) ‚Äì Romantic Love
    	‚Ä¢	Meaning: Passionate or romantic love, often associated with desire.
    	‚Ä¢	In the Bible: While the exact Greek word eros does not appear in the New Testament, the concept is present in the Song of Solomon (celebrating marital intimacy).
    	‚Ä¢	Healthy View: God created eros for marriage, pointing to intimacy and covenant.

    
- 2  Philia (œÜŒπŒªŒØŒ±) ‚Äì Friendship Love
    	‚Ä¢	Meaning: Affectionate love between friends or siblings; mutual care.
    	‚Ä¢	In the Bible: Used in John 15:13‚Äì15, when Jesus says, ‚ÄúGreater love (philia) has no one than this: to lay down one‚Äôs life for one‚Äôs friends.‚Äù
    	‚Ä¢	Healthy View: This is brotherly/sisterly love, the foundation for fellowship and community (think of Philadelphia ‚Äî ‚Äúcity of brotherly love‚Äù).
    
- 3  Agapƒì (·ºÄŒ≥Œ¨œÄŒ∑) ‚Äì Unconditional, Divine Love
    	‚Ä¢	Meaning: Selfless, sacrificial love that seeks the good of others.
    	‚Ä¢	In the Bible: The highest form of love, used in John 3:16 (‚ÄúFor God so loved [agapƒì] the world that He gave His one and only Son‚Äù).
    	‚Ä¢	Healthy View: This is God‚Äôs love for us, and the love He calls us to show to others. It‚Äôs not based on feelings but on willful, sacrificial action.

[Verse 1]
When the music fades

All is stripped away

And I simply come

Longing just to bring

Something that's of worth

That will bless Your heart

\

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself

Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear

You're looking into my heart

\

[Chorus]
I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

\

[Verse 2]
King of endless worth

No one could express

How much you deserve

Though I'm weak and poor

All I have is Yours

Every single breath!

\

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself

Is not what You have required

You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear

You're looking into my heart 

\

[Chorus]

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

And it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about You, it's all about You, Jesus

\

[Outro]

All about you

I'll bring you more than a song

I'll bring you more than a song

More than a song

I'll bring you more than a song

I'll bring you more than a song
(than a song)

You're looking into my heart, looking into my heart

You're looking into my heart

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

I'll bring You more than a song

## üéµ Lyric highlights {background-image="images/vincentiu-solomon-ln5drpv_ImI-unsplash.jpg" background-size="cover" background-color="black"}

  - "Change my heart o God" is written by Eddie Espinosa in 1982, this worship classic emerged not in a studio, but from a moment of heartfelt prayer.
  -	The inspiration struck while Espinosa was stuck in traffic near Disneyland, praying for God to transform his heart. He began to sing the lyrics spontaneously, as if receiving divine dictation. At the next light, he grabbed scrap paper to jot down the words, preserving the song that would soon resonate worldwide. 
  -	The lyrics ‚ÄúChange my heart, O God‚Ä¶ may I be like You‚Äù express raw humility and sincere surrender. It‚Äôs a proactive, personal prayer to become more like Jesus.
	- Teaching the story behind the song‚Äîwritten in a traffic jam‚Äîhelps youth see that God inspires worship even in everyday moments.

## Bible study: **Crucified ‚Äì Old Self Declared Dead**

**Theme Scripture:**\
**Galatians 2:20** (NKJV)

\

‚ÄúI have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.‚Äù

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîç Related Scriptures

-   **Galatians 5:24** ‚Äì ‚ÄúThose who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.‚Äù

-   **Romans 6:4‚Äì6** ‚Äì ‚ÄúOur old self was crucified‚Ä¶ that we might walk in newness of life.‚Äù

-   **Colossians 3:3‚Äì4** ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.‚Äù      

-   **2 Corinthians 5:15** ‚Äì ‚Äú‚Ä¶so that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who died and was raised.‚Äù

## üìñ Bible Study: Galatians 2:20

### Exposition in four points:

-   **Paradox of death & life** ‚Äì Though ‚Äúdead‚Äù to the old self, we *live* spiritually **through** Christ\
-   **Not I, but Christ** ‚Äì Our new identity is Christ Himself living in us‚ÄîHe shapes our thoughts and actions.
-   **Living by faith** ‚Äì Our daily life is sustained not by law or self-effort, but by trusting Jesus.
-   **Christ‚Äôs sacrificial love** ‚Äì His death was personal and intentional: ‚Äúwho loved me and gave himself for me‚Äù.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üí° Application Points

1.  **Let go of past labels** ‚Äî physically discard labels that no longer define you.\
2.  **Welcome Christ‚Äôs life** ‚Äî begin your day saying, ‚ÄúChrist lives in me.‚Äù\
3.  **Practice daily faith** ‚Äî before tasks, pause and choose to trust Christ.\
4.  **Live out gratitude** ‚Äî look for ways today to express thanks for His sacrifice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üó£Ô∏è Discussion Questions

-   What ‚Äúold labels‚Äù or habits feel like they define you?
-   What does your life look like *after* being ‚Äúcrucified‚Äù with Christ?
-   How can trusting Christ shape decisions this week?
-   How does knowing He died specifically for **you** change your identity?

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## üîπ Week 2 ‚Äì Christ Lives in Me

**Key Scripture:**  
**Romans 8:10** (ESV)  
> *"But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness."*  

---

### üß† Discussion Questions
- What does it mean that *Christ lives in me* rather than just *I live like Christ*?
- How does His presence shape your decisions, friendships, and emotions?
- Can you share a moment when you sensed Jesus actively guiding or comforting you?

---

### üéØ Applications
- **Mirror Affirmation:** Write ‚ÄúChrist lives in me‚Äù on a mirror; declare it aloud each morning.
- **Soul Check-Ins:** Pause 2‚Äì3 times daily to ask: ‚ÄúAm I living from Christ in me or from my own strength?‚Äù
- **Prayer Prompt:** *‚ÄúJesus, help me sense Your life within me today.‚Äù*

---

## üîπ Week 3 ‚Äì Living by Faith in the Son of God

**Key Scripture:**  
**Galatians 3:11** (ESV)  
> *"Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for ‚ÄúThe righteous shall live by faith."*  

---

### üß† Discussion Questions
- What‚Äôs the difference between living by faith vs. trying harder on your own?
- Which areas of your life need stronger trust in Christ?
- Why is faith in *the Son of God* different than any other kind of faith?

---

### üéØ Applications
- **Faith Journal:** Write down one area needing faith daily ("trust in exams," "friendship conflict") and note where God shows up.
- **Accountability Pair:** Share your faith goal for the week; check in midweek.
- **Prayer Prompt:** *‚ÄúGod, help me to live today by faith in Your Son, not by my own strength.‚Äù*

---

## üîπ Week D ‚Äì Loved & Given for Me

**Key Scripture:**  
**John 15:13** (ESV)  
> *"Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends."* 

**Galatians‚ÄØ2:20** reminder  
> *‚Äú‚Ä¶who loved me and gave himself for me.‚Äù*

---

### üß† Discussion Questions
- What difference does it make that Jesus *personally* gave Himself for *you*?
- Have you experienced sacrificial love that reminded you of Christ‚Äôs?
- How can you show sacrificial love to someone this week?

---

### üéØ Applications
- **Gratitude Prayer:** Spend quiet time thanking Jesus for His love; share one personal gratitude each.
- **Love in Action:** Commit to one sacrificial act (helping someone, encouraging, volunteering).
- **Reflection Prompt:** *‚ÄúHow does knowing I‚Äôm personally loved empower me to love others?‚Äù*




## üôè Prayer & Reflection

-   **Quiet moment**: Sit with Galatians‚ÄØ2:20, asking God to reveal areas still tied to your old self.
-   **Group prayer**: ‚ÄúChrist, thank You‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve replaced my old self with Your life. Help me walk by faith today.‚Äù
